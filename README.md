# Drive alone

Some time ago, I discovered a very nice video (obviously not from me) : [![Alt text for your video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Aut32pR5PQA/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aut32pR5PQA)

I decided to retro-engineer that, **without a glimpse at the source code**. Also, I decided to do everything in vanilla Javascript, from scratch. That's right! No plugin, no framework, no Node.js.

## What I did

### Graphics

Displaying the cars, the track, the captors, etc. is a project in itself.

### Neural network

A non-usual neural network, without any back propagation, but slight random modifications from a generation to the other.

### Unit tests

Yeah, because when you do everything from scratch, you also do the unit tests from scratch. So there is also a fully functional unit test library included in this project.

### More

A few things are also included, but I'll let you find out by looking in the source code :wink:. The most important thing about this project is:

> **Nothing** is perfect! I've been learning while doing it.

## Collaborate

Please feel free to collaborate, I'll look at any pull request and consider any idea. As usual on my projects: **newbies welcome**.
