                <p class="question">What are those rectangles doing there? And why are they sending beams in front of them? Can't we tell them what to do? They seem really bad at what they do, whatever it is.</p>
                <p class="answer">Wow, calm down there! One at the time, raise your hand and get a ticket.</p>
                <p class="answer">First, those little rectangles symbolize cars, and those wierd looking beams are actually captors. Each captor gives the car a single information: a number representing the distance to the closest wall in that direction.</p>
                <p class="answer">As for telling them what to do, why would you spoil it all and break that amazing learning circle?</p>
                <p class="question">Learning circle? Do you mean to make me believe those blocks can learn anything?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes, you got it! Those cars have a brain…</p>
                <p class="question">A brain‽</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes, but let me finish, they have a syntethic brain, displayed in the second panel, that slowly adapts to their environment to finally figure out by themselves how to move to their goal.</p>
